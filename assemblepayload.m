function [ payload, payloadSize ] = assemblepayload( watermark )
%UNTITLED Assambles the payload that is to be encoded into a signal
%   A Watermark can not just be encoded by itself. Due to TSM and for WMK
%   detection there have to be synchronization code segments, that are
%   hopefully distinctivly detectable without any false positive error.
%   The payload consists of two parts. The synchronisation code and the
%   watermark data. There is always a whole synchronization code followed
%   by X bit of watermark data. Then there is a synchronization code
%   segment again. If the watermark data does not satisfy
%   (data mod wmk_sequence_length = 0), then the watermark has to be
%   extended with dummy bits.

% TODO: Update comments above:
% the watermark must be only as long as the audio signal samples can hold
% the error-corrected-encoded-watermark which should be (depending on the
% encoding) abourt 1/3 of the bit capacity. if this hold, the payload
% returned by this function is ensured to fit in the watermark
