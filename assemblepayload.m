function [ payload ] = assemblepayload( watermark )
%UNTITLED Assambles the payload that is to be encoded into a signal
%   A Watermark can not just be encoded by itself. Due to TSM and for WMK
%   detection there have to be synchronization code segments, that are
%   hopefully distinctivly detectable without any false positive error.
%   The payload consists of two parts. The synchronisation code and the
%   watermark data. There is always a whole synchronization code followed
%   by X bit of watermark data. Then there is a synchronization code
%   segment again. If the watermark data does not satisfy
%   (data mod wmk_sequence_length = 0), then the watermark has to be
%   extended with dummy bits.

wmkBlockSequenceLength   = Setting.wmkdata_block_sequence_length;

wmkSize = size(watermark);
wmkSize = wmkSize(2);


% check if watermark needs dummy bits
% extend watermark if need be
if mod(wmkSize, wmkBlockSequenceLength) ~= 0
    missing = wmkBlockSequenceLength - mod(wmkSize, wmkBlockSequenceLength);
    watermark(wmkSize+1: wmkSize+missing) = 0;
    wmkSize = size(watermark);

wmkBlockCount = ceil(wmkSize/wmkBlockSequenceLength);


% reshape the watermark, so we can index the segments easily
watermark = reshape(watermark, wmkBlockSequenceLength, wmkBlockCount);
watermark = watermark';


% for each wmk_segment there is a sync_code
% therefore total payload length is as follows:
payloadLength = dataStructBlockSequenceLength * wmkBlockCount;

payload = zeros([1, payloadLength]); % preallocate 1 x bitCount array


payloadCursor = 1;
for i=1:wmkBlockCount
    
    window = payloadCursor : payloadCursor+syncBlockSequenceLength-1;
    
    % insert sync code

    window = payloadCursor : payloadCursor+wmkBlockSequenceLength-1;

    payload(window) = watermark(i,:);
    
    % move cursor to the next sync block
